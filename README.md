# Accountability Tower Defense Game
What better way to get people to live healthier than to
introduce a bit of friendly competition?

This project was a collaborative effort and was our team's submission for HackDFW 2021. 
Our goal was to create an application which could be used to promote
healthy living.  

This project serves as a demo for a tower defense game in which calories burnt in a day are used
as currency to purchase defending towers and also to send waves of enemies (unhealthy food)
to your accountability partner's base. 

## Method: 
We used Pygame to create the game logic, map layout, and GUI for the tower defense game
and used Sockets to handle multiplayer functionality using a client-server paradigm.

## What I Learned: 
I was unfamiliar with Python and PyGame before doing this project, and I came away 
from it with a greater understanding of both. My teammates were more familiar with PyGame
and I assisted them with elements of tower defense game logic, such as rate of fire, target selection, and
enemy pathing. 

Sockets, and networking of any kind, was entirely unfamiliar to me and
introducing multiplayer functionality was my primary contribution to this project. 

I watched several videos and tested several things before finally getting a connection established.

In the final hour of the submission window, our game was functional but it would not run 
using the clients and server we had created. With 15 minutes to go, I figured out
that our game needed to be run on the client files themselves and not separately,
and this was the last piece we needed to submit.

## Reflections
Doing this Hackathon and working on this project was an immensely rewarding learning opportunity
and the satisfaction of getting the Sockets to work was tremendous.
I'm very grateful for my awesome teammates for their PyGame know-how 
and for teaching it to me, as well!
